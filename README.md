## 👨‍💻 Who I Am

I'm **Serge Kadjo**, a technical founder and systems engineer specializing in **AI, hardware engineering, and product development**. With over a decade building physical products and software systems, I bridge the gap between hardware and AI—solving problems that require both deep technical knowledge and entrepreneurial execution.

### My Mission
**Making hardware development 10x faster through AI-powered tools and intelligent automation.**

I believe hardware innovation moves too slowly. While software teams ship daily, hardware engineers struggle with months-long cycles, poor collaboration tools, and manual documentation. I'm changing that with **ProductFlo** and **Haitch**—our 7-billion parameter AI model trained specifically for hardware engineering.

### Background
- **10+ years** in hardware product development and systems engineering
- **Multiple founder** (AI healthcare, SaaS, IoT hardware, renewable energy)
- **Full-stack builder** from embedded firmware to cloud infrastructure
- **AI systems architect** with focus on domain-specific LLM applications
- **Atlanta → Brooklyn** entrepreneur building in the deep tech space

## 🌱 Philosophy & Approach

### How I Build
> "Think like a scientist, build like an engineer, execute like a founder."

**First principles thinking:** Break problems down to fundamentals, question assumptions, rebuild from ground truth.

**Rapid iteration:** Ship early, learn fast, iterate based on real feedback—not theory.

**Cross-disciplinary innovation:** The best solutions come from combining hardware, software, and AI in novel ways.

**Impact over hype:** Build things that actually work and solve real problems—not just impressive demos.

### What Drives Me
The gap between software and hardware innovation is too wide. Software teams ship features daily; hardware teams take years. This inefficiency holds back crucial innovations in renewable energy, medical devices, robotics, and sustainable manufacturing.

**I'm on a mission to close that gap with AI-powered tools that make hardware development as fast and collaborative as software development.**
